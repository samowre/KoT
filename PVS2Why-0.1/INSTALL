Release: PVS2Why-0.1 (11/10/07) 
By Cesar Munoz 
http://research.nianet.org/~munoz/PVS2Why

Requirements
------------
- PVS 4.0 or higher, available from http://pvs.csl.sri.com.
- PVS package ProofLite, available from 
  http://research.nianet.org/~munoz/ProofLite

General instructions
--------------------
Copy the tarball file PVS2Why-0.1.tgz to the directory where you are
planning to put PVS packages, e.g., <packages>. An appropriate
location is <packages> = <pvs-dir>/lib. Note that you will need write
permissions on <packages> and <pvs-dir> in order to install this
package.

Unpack the file: 

  $ tar xfz <packages>/PVS2Why-0.1.tgz

The directory <packages>/PVS2Why-0.1 contains:
 
   README     : PVS2Why in a nutshell
   INSTALL    : This file
   Makefile   : Make file
   lib/       : Library 
   java/      : Java library for PVS2Why
   src/       : Sources 	  
   examples/  : Examples
   doc/       : Documentation

Installation
------------
Type

  $ make PVS_DIR=<pvs-dir>

Alternatively, make a symbolic link <packages>/PVS2Why to 
<packages>/PVS2Why-0.1/lib, copy the script src/pvs2why.sh 
to <pvs-dir>/pvs2why, and configure it to your installation.

Setting PVS_LIBRARY_PATH
------------------------
If you have chosen <packages> = <pvs-dir>/lib, you don't need to set
the environment variable PVS_LIBRARY_PATH. Otherwise, set this
variable such that it includes the directory <packages>. The easiest
way to do this is by defining a global variable PVS_LIBRARY_PATH in
the start-up file of your login shell.  In bash, add the line

  export PVS_LIBRARY_PATH=$PVS_LIBRARY_PATH:<packages>

to the .bash_profile file. In csh, add the line

  setenv PVS_LIBRARY_PATH  $PVS_LIBRARY_PATH:<packages>

to the .cshrc file.

Checking the installation
-------------------------
Run PVS2Why on some example to verify that the package was
installed correctly. For example, type  

  $ make test PVS_DIR=<pvs-dir>

Using pvs2why
-------------
For usage type:

  $<pvs-dir>/pvs2why --help

In most cases,

  $<pvs-dir>/pvs2why --xml --java <mypvsfile> 

is all you need.

Troubleshooting
---------------
0. How to remove an old installation of PVS2Why ?

   An old installation of PVS2Why is usually not a problem as 
   the makefile tries to make obsolete a previous installation of the package. 
   Sometimes, it does not manage to do that. In this case, the main point 
   is that there must be only ONE symbolic link called PVS2Why located 
   in PVS_LIBRARY_PATH, and this link must point to the lib directory of the
   most recent installation.
  
   Once the new release is installed, you can remove the distribution 
   directory of the previous release. The makefile doesn't do that for you.

1. I want to turn off all the checks performed by the Makefile.

   If you know what you are doing, type 

   $ make PVS_DIR=<pvs-dir> FORCE=yes
