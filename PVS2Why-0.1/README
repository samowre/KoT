Release: PVS2Why-0.1 (11/10/07) 
By: Leonard Lensink (University of Nijmegen), Cesar Munoz (NIA)
http://research.nianet.org/~munoz/PVS2Why

PVS2Why is a code generator for PVS. It does that by first translating
a functional PVS specification to the intermediate language used by
the Why tool (http://why.lri.fr) and from there, theoretically, to any
modern programming language. So far, only Java 1.5 and XML pseudo-code
are supported.

PVS2Why uses a memory optimization technique inspired on the technique
originally developed by Shankar [Shankar99] and implemented in the PVS
ground evaluator. This technique analyzes the PVS original
specification and generates code that uses destructive updates as much
as possible.

This is a pre-alpha release and as such it is not suitable for
serious developments. PVS2Why partially supports records, arrays, 
second-order functions, undefined functions, parameters, etc.


Installation
------------
See INSTALL for installation instructions, and the directories examples/ and
doc/ for examples and documentation, respectively. 


Usage
-----
The installation creates a command line utility pvs2why in <PVS_DIR>.

<PVS_DIR>/pvs2why --help
Usage: pvs2why {<option>}* {<pvsfile>}+
Translates PVS functional specifications in <pvsfile> into Why. XML
and Java representations are supported.
Options:
 -h|--help                  print this message
 -l|--lisp <lisp>           PVS lisp version [allegro,cmulisp]
 -v|--version               print version information
 -p|--packages <p1>,..,<pn> load packages <p1>,..,<pn>
 -x|--xml                   generate XML code
 -j|--java                  generate Java code
Single one letter options can be combined.

Java
----
The Java code generated by PVS2Why uses features that are only available
in Java 1.5 (or higher), e.g., generic types, varags, auto boxing, etc.

Furthermore, it imports the package PVS2Java which is included in the
directory java/ of the distribution.

To compile a file <Theory>.java generated by PVS2Why, type:

$ javac -cp <wherever>/PVS2Java.jar:. <Theory>.java

See the example in in the directory examples/ of the distribution.
